## Password-Protected Web Server User Guide

## Overview:
This Python script creates a simple HTTP server that requires a password passed as a query parameter in the URL. If the correct password is provided, the user gains access to special content. If the password is incorrect or missing, access is denied, and an error message is displayed.

## Requirements:

Python 3.x installed on your system.
Basic knowledge of running Python scripts in a terminal or command prompt.
Setup and Running the Server

## Save the Script:

Copy the provided Python code into a text editor.
Save the file as password_protected_server.py on your local machine.
Set the Correct Password

Open the password_protected_server.py file in a text editor.
Locate the following line in the code:
correct_password = "YOURPASSWORDISHERE"
Replace "YOURPASSWORDISHERE" with your actual password. For example:
correct_password = "mySuperSecret123"
Save the file after making this change.
Running the Server

Open a terminal or command prompt window on your computer.
Navigate to the directory where the password_protected_server.py script is saved. Use the cd command to change directories.
Start the server by running the following command:
python password_protected_server.py
The server will start running and will listen on port 8000. You should see a message like this:
Starting server at http://127.0.0.1:8000
The server will be accessible locally at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
Accessing the Server

Open a web browser on the same computer where the server is running.
To test the server without entering a password, visit:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Since no password is provided, you will see an "Access Denied" page indicating that you need to provide a password in the URL.
To access the server with the correct password, add the password as a query parameter in the URL. For example:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/?password=mySuperSecret123
Replace mySuperSecret123 with the password you set in the script.
Server Responses

## Correct Password: 
If the password entered in the URL matches the one you set in the script, the server will return a page saying:
Access Granted! Correct password entered. Here is the special content.
Incorrect Password: If the password is wrong, the server will return a page that says:
Access Denied! Incorrect password. Try again.
Missing Password: If the password query parameter is missing, the server will show:
YOUR CODE IS HERE!!!
This message is displayed when no password is supplied in the request.
Error Handling

If there is an issue reading the password or other configuration issues, the server will respond with a 500 error, displaying:
Server Error. Please check if you input your password correctly.
If the server fails to read the password correctly from the file or encounters other exceptions, an error message will be shown.

## Secure the Password: 
Currently, the password is hardcoded in the script. For added security, you may want to implement password encryption or store it in an external file or database. However, for this simple implementation, the password is read directly from the script.

## Troubleshooting:

"Access Denied!" Even with the Correct Password:
Double-check that the password in the URL exactly matches the one set in the script, including any capitalization.
Ensure that the query parameter is correctly formatted. The URL should be:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/?password=mySuperSecret123

## Server Doesn't Start:
If the server fails to start, check that Python is installed and accessible in your terminal. You can check this by running:
python --version
If Python isn't installed, download and install it from python.org
